A lightweight, browser-based stopwatch application built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This project provides a simple interface to track time in minutes, seconds, and tens of milliseconds.

## Features

- **Precise Timing:** Tracks time in `MM:SS:MS` format.
- **Controls:**
  - **Start:** Begins the timer loop.
  - **Stop:** Pauses the timer without resetting the values.
  - **Reset:** Stops the timer and clears all values back to `00:00:00`.
- **Design:** Centered, responsive layout with a backdrop image.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5:** Semantic structure.
- **CSS3:** Flexbox for layout and styling.
- **JavaScript (ES6):** DOM manipulation and `setInterval` logic for timing events.

## Project Structure

The project is self-contained within a single HTML file for ease of use, though it references a background image.
